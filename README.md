## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice the **mobile-first approach**, ensuring that the layout looks great on small screens first, and then adapting it to larger ones.  
I also improved my understanding of **Flexbox alignment** to center content both vertically and horizontally.

Example of the CSS centering used:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep improving in:

- Responsive design for complex layouts
- Using CSS Grid for components with multiple sections
- Creating reusable styles with variables
